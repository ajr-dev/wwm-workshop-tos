# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** December 25, 2025

Your privacy is a priority for **WWM Workshop**. This policy explains how we handle data and why we collect only what is strictly necessary to function.

## 1. Data Collection & Usage
Unlike many Discord bots, WWM Workshop is designed to operate without tracking users.

* **No Personal Data:** We do **not** collect or store Discord User IDs, Server IDs, Usernames, Avatars, or IP addresses.
* **Message Intents:** The Bot uses Discord Message Intents to read QR code attachments or text-based codes provided by the user. This data is processed in temporary memory to perform the conversion and is discarded immediately after.
* **Conversion Storage:** We store the **input code** and the **converted output code** in our database. This is done solely to prevent the Bot from needing to regenerate a code that has already been converted, ensuring efficiency and speed for the community.

## 2. Third-Party Sharing
* **No Third Parties:** We do not share, sell, or provide any data to third-party services.
* **No External APIs:** All conversion logic is handled internally. We do not send your inputs to external AI or processing APIs.

## 3. Data Retention
* **Converted Codes:** Because game codes are anonymous and not linked to any user identity, they are stored indefinitely in our database for reuse.
* **Logs:** We do not keep logs of who requested which code.

## 4. User Rights (Access & Deletion)
Because we do not store any identifying information (such as your Discord ID), we have no data linked to your person. Consequently:
* We cannot provide you with a copy of "your" data because we do not know which data belongs to you.
* We cannot delete specific user history as no such history is tracked.

## 5. Security
We implement standard security measures to protect our database of converted codes. However, as the database contains no personal information, there is no risk of personal identity exposure in the event of a data breach.

## 6. Contact Information
